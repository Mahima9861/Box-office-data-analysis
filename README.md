# Box-office-data-analysis
This project is based on Analyzing Box Office Data with Seaborn and Python. I have worked with the The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. 
The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. 
-We build models to accurately predict movie revenue
-Find relationship between film revenue and budget
-Does having an official homepage affect revenue?
-Distribution of languages in film
-Frequent words in film titles and descriptions
-Do film descriptions impact revenue?


The statistical data visualization libraries Seaborn and Plotly will be our workhorses to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs.
